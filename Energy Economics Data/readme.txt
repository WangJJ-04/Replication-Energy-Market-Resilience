ENERGY ECONOMICS DATA: FILES, UNITS, AND SAMPLE
=============================================

1. PURPOSE AND PACKAGE LAYOUT
-----------------------------
This folder contains prepared monthly inputs for the energy-market resilience
analysis. Keep it beside Energy Economics Code under the same parent directory.
The Code README provides the full MATLAB -> resilience -> Python -> R workflow.

The folder contains four primary monthly input files:

  VAR_100data.xlsx
  VAR_data.csv
  markov_100data_167.csv
  markov_scale_data_166.csv

The horizon_resilience/ subfolder additionally contains three archived
resilience workbooks for the H = 6, 8, and 10 comparison figure (Section 8).

The preferred VAR and variable-summary input is VAR_100data.xlsx. The CSV
VAR_data.csv retains decimal energy returns as a reference series. It is not
the percentage-scale input configured in the main scripts.

2. FILE INVENTORY
-----------------
File                         Observations  Period                    Main use
---------------------------  ------------  ------------------------  --------------------------
VAR_100data.xlsx              167           Jan 2010-Nov 2023         MATLAB VAR and R summaries
VAR_data.csv                 167           Jan 2010-Nov 2023         Decimal-return reference
markov_100data_167.csv        167           Jan 2010-Nov 2023         R macrofinancial summaries
markov_scale_data_166.csv     166           Feb 2010-Nov 2023         Python Markov regressors

The workbook contains one worksheet, VAR_100data. The listed observation counts
exclude the header row. All four primary input files have a first column named
date. These primary files have no missing cells or duplicate monthly dates.

Dates are stored as month-start ISO 8601 strings, for example:
  2010-01-01T00:00:00Z
Preserve the monthly order and date labels when importing the files.

3. VAR_100data.xlsx: PREFERRED VAR INPUT
----------------------------------------
Columns, in the required order, are:

  date, GPR, CPU, OPU, OIL, NG, COAL, ERIX, EUA

The existing date column is also the calendar for the R baseline and
horizon-comparison figures. Both plotting blocks read it automatically from
sheet VAR_100data. Its 167 monthly dates cover January 2010-November 2023;
observations 2-167 provide the 166 dates for resilience and Markov analysis,
February 2010-November 2023. No separate date workbook is needed.

Uncertainty indicators:
  GPR: geopolitical risk index, in index levels.
  CPU: climate policy uncertainty index, in index levels.
  OPU: oil price uncertainty index, in index levels.

Energy-market series:
  OIL: Brent crude oil front-month futures.
  NG: Henry Hub natural gas front-month futures.
  COAL: Newcastle thermal coal front-month futures.
  ERIX: European Renewable Energy Total Return Index.
  EUA: EU ETS carbon allowance front-month futures.

The five energy columns contain monthly log returns multiplied by 100:

  return_percent = 100 * log(P_current / P_previous)

The uncertainty columns are untransformed index levels. These prepared inputs
are not standardized within this file. tvpvar_main.m standardizes the eight
numerical columns using zscore() before fitting the TVP-VAR-SV model. The R
variable-summary script describes the workbook in its supplied units.

The workbook contains transformed returns and index observations, rather than
the original daily prices or the energy price levels used to construct returns.
Variable definitions and source citations are provided in the manuscript's
variable-definition and data-source table.

4. VAR_data.csv: DECIMAL-RETURN REFERENCE
-----------------------------------------
This CSV has the same dates, column order, and three uncertainty-index series
as VAR_100data.xlsx. Its five energy-market returns are expressed as decimal
log returns:

  return_decimal = log(P_current / P_previous)
  return_percent = 100 * return_decimal

For example, the first OIL observation is approximately -0.086673 in the CSV
and -8.667314 in the workbook. The unit distinction applies only to OIL, NG,
COAL, ERIX, and EUA. GPR, CPU, OPU, and the date labels are unchanged.

The main scripts use the workbook directly. Keep its existing percentage-scale
values when importing it; no further return scaling is needed.

5. markov_100data_167.csv: UNSTANDARDIZED MACROFINANCIAL DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------
Columns are:

  date, DXY, GSCPI, CPI, Industrial

The file contains transformed monthly conditioning variables on their original
analysis scales:

  DXY: 100 times the monthly log change in the U.S. Dollar Index.
  GSCPI: 100 times the monthly first difference in the Global Supply Chain
         Pressure Index. Positive values indicate tightening supply pressure;
         negative values indicate easing pressure.
  CPI: 100 times the monthly log change in the Consumer Price Index.
  Industrial: 100 times the monthly log change in the Industrial Production Index.

Thus GSCPI uses a first difference, while the other three use log changes.
The file is unstandardized and covers the full 167-month descriptive sample.
ee_descriptive_statistics.r joins it to VAR_100data.xlsx by date for the
main-variable summary table. It is separate from the standardized input used
to estimate the Markov regressions.

6. markov_scale_data_166.csv: STANDARDIZED MARKOV INPUT
------------------------------------------------------
Columns are the same as in the unstandardized macrofinancial file:

  date, DXY, GSCPI, CPI, Industrial

The 166-month file is constructed by:

  1. Taking rows 2:167 of the 167-observation macrofinancial data, which removes
     January 2010 and retains February 2010-November 2023.
  2. Standardizing each numerical column over those retained 166 observations:

       z_t = (x_t - mean_166(x)) / sample_SD_166(x)

The sample SD uses denominator n-1, equivalent to R scale() or pandas
std(ddof=1). Each supplied conditioning series has mean approximately zero
and sample SD one. Standardization is performed on the 166-month sample,
after removing the first observation.

Markov.ipynb reads these standardized values directly. The series are aligned
by row order with the 166 resilience observations; preserve both the dates and
the common chronological order when using this file.

7. CONNECTION TO GENERATED RESILIENCE AND MODEL OUTPUTS
-------------------------------------------------------
The MATLAB VAR input has 167 months. With nlag = 1, the initial sample period
has no valid estimated response path, leaving 166 resilience observations.
The generated workbook is stored under the Code package:

  Energy Economics Code/matlab code/resilience_metrics.xlsx

Its t indices run from 2 to 167 and correspond to February 2010-November 2023.
Its columns are t, Variable, RP, and RD. RP is the output name for resilience
intensity (RI). This is a generated result, not one of the four source inputs
in the Data folder.

The Python notebook combines that resilience workbook with
markov_scale_data_166.csv, then exports state probabilities and Wald tests to:

  Energy Economics Code/python code/output/

The R descriptive statistics use the 167-month files before standardization;
the Markov regressions use the 166-month standardized macrofinancial input.
This accounts for the different sample lengths and units in the two stages.

8. horizon_resilience/: HORIZON-COMPARISON INPUTS
-----------------------------------------------
This subfolder contains the existing analysis workbooks used by R Block 3:

  resilience_metrics_median6.xlsx   H = 6
  resilience_metrics_median.xlsx    H = 8
  resilience_metrics_median10.xlsx  H = 10

Each workbook contains t, Variable, RP, and RD, with 166 observations for each
of the 64 shock-response combinations. The sample indices are t = 2,...,167,
corresponding to February 2010-November 2023. These are precomputed resilience
measures, separate from the four monthly VAR/macrofinancial source inputs.
The original comparison files were copied without changing their contents.

The R plotting script reads this packaged subfolder using PROJECT_DIR; no
personal Desktop directory is required. Its comparison PDF is saved to the
common <project root>/Fig/ folder. The MATLAB README, Section 9, describes the
H/N/worksheet-row settings for generating alternative-horizon workbooks.
